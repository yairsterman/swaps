        In order to assure our users and their homes are safe during travels, Swaps asks that you set aside a security deposit to cover for possible property damages or cancelations. <strong>The entire sum of the deposit is returned to you after your trip</strong>. In fact, the security deposit never even leaves your bank account, so you can rest easy.

                Because paying hundreds of dollars for a dull hotel room, a bland guesthouse, or an impersonal vacation apartment is a waste of money and a boring way to travel.

                <br>
                Because leaving your home unattended and empty while you're away is a waste of space.

                How can I trust a Swapper if I haven’t ever met them and don’t yet know them?

            <span class="collapse" id="howCanITrust">
First of all, we encourage you to contact and get to know your fellow Swapper before confirming a Swap. But besides that, Swaps has built a review system where Swappers are asked to rate their stays at other fellow Swappers homes. These reviews and ratings serve as an excellent means to judge whether a particular home or particular Swapper is a good fit for you.
                <br>
                <br>
Furthermore, In order to assure our users and their homes are safe during travels, Swaps asks that you set aside a security deposit before a swap is confirmed. The security deposit serves as a guarantee to cover for possible property damages or cancellations. In this way, trust is quickly built between Swappers and bad eggs are deterred from using the site. Of course, even in rare cases of damages or unexpected cancellations, you will be compensated.
                <br>
                <br>
Finally, Swaps is uncompromising when it comes to your security. We place a real emphasis on screening out and detecting malicious or untrustworthy people, and on removing them immediately from the site. We have put in place a strict set of terms and conditions to best ensure that our users stay safe, no matter where they are or who stays at their home. As a matter of policy, any user who violates Swaps’ rules, endangers other Swappers or their belongings, or behaves inappropriately towards other Swappers will be immediately banned from the site. We are happy to say that so far, we have not had to ban anyone, but we are prepared for any case.

                How is Swaps different from Airbnb?
                <div class="underline"></div>
            </div>
            <span class="collapse" id="differentFromAirbnb">
                Both Swaps and Airbnb present accommodation solutions for travelers based on sharing-economy principles. However, Airbnb and Swaps approach the issue differently, and are geared toward different audiences.
                <br>
                <br>
                With Airbnb, the process is essentially a monetary transaction similar to booking a hotel room. This means one side sets a price for the value of renting a place, while the other pays for the service. Meanwhile, AirBnb charges both sides for its role in facilitating the transaction. The AirBnb model is best suited for people who are willing to pay a substantial amount for proper accommodation.
                <br>
                <br>
                With Swaps, on the other hand, you will avoid all the usual expenses that come with accommodation during travel. The transaction between Swappers is not a monetary one, but rather a truly sharing-economy based solution with each side providing the other with a convenient and comfortable home.
                 <br>
                <br>
                The Swaps model assures you don’t blow your budget on accommodation during your trips, and helps you keep your home safe while you travel.

                Remember, your first Swap deal (regardless of its length) is on us! You’ll still have to set aside a security deposit, but it will be returned to you in full after the Swap, and the Swap deal itself is free.

                The security deposit is not charged to Swaps, but rather a credit limit is designated to Swaps in your bank or paypal account. This means that the security deposit remains in your account and is not charged at all, except in cases where damages were claimed, or if you cancelled a Swap too close to the scheduled Swap date.

                Yes, Swaps charges some or all of the security deposit in two rare cases -- if damage claims were filed by the Swapper with which you swapped homes, and if you cancelled a Swap too close to a scheduled Swap date.

                Since Swappers who confirmed a swap are counting on each other, last minute cancellations can cause major inconveniences. Swaps has set up a cancellation fee, which is used as a compensation that protects Swappers and assures that they are never left stranded in case of an unexpected cancellation.

                We understand that sometimes there are circumstances that are out of control and that the need to cancel a confirmed Swap my sometimes occur. For that reason, we allow the cancellation of a confirmed Swap <strong>up to one week before the date of the Swap</strong>. However, Since Swappers who confirmed a Swap are counting on each other, last minute cancellations can cause major inconveniences. Therefore, if a Swapper cancelled a Swap less than one week ahead of the confirmed Swap date, Swaps will charge the sum of the security deposit from the canceling Swapper. The funds charged by Swaps will be given as compensation to the second Swapper whose swap had been canceled through no fault of his own, in order to allow the Swapper to pay for alternative accommodation.

                No, we don’t charge a cleaning fee and you do not need to pay for such a service. We only ask that our swappers leave a clean home before they depart on their trip, and return the home at which they stayed in the condition they received it. Of course, you can still discuss your cleaning preferences with other swappers before your trip.
