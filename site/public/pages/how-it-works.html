        In order to assure our users and their homes are safe during travels, Swaps asks that you set aside a security deposit to cover for possible property damages or cancellations. <strong>The entire sum of the deposit is returned to you after your trip</strong>. In fact, the security deposit never even leaves your bank account, so you can rest easy. (How can this be? <a href="/faq#securityDeposit"> Click here for more information about the security deposit.</a>)

For a <strong>ridiculously low price</strong>, Swaps will give you the peace of mind you need in order to live life with no excuses and travel the world with no regrets.
