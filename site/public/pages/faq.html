        Top Questions
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Why should I swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Because it’s worth it.
        <br>
        <br>
        Most often, the highest travel expense is accommodation. Staying for even a few nights at a hotel, a guesthouse, or a vacation apartment typically costs hundreds of dollars, and if you have kids, the price is just too damn high.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the same time, many travelers leave their own home unattended and empty while they are away, or have to go through the lengthy, draining, and sometimes legally questionable process of finding a sublet ahead of their travels. And if no subletter is not found, travelers are forced to absorb a double expense in the form of rent payment while also paying for their stay abroad, at the same time.
        <br>
        <br>
        Swaps’ home-swapping system gets rid of all those problems. For the price of a cheap cup of coffee, you can stay at a wonderful home wherever you go, live like a local, and avoid all the expenses that come with accommodations abroad, or rent payment and legal issues at home. Swaps also secures and covers you for potential damages to your belongings at home or unexpected cancellations, protects you from shady users, and gives you the peace of mind you need when you travel.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        How is Swaps different from AirBnb?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        While both Swaps and AirBnb present accommodation solutions for travelers based on sharing-economy principles, the two companies approach the issue differently, and are geared toward a different audiences. With AirBnb, the process is essentially a monetary transaction similar to booking a room in a hotel. One side sets a price for the value of renting a place, while the other pays for the service. Meanwhile, AirBnb charges both sides for its role in facilitating the transaction. The AirBnb model is best suited for people who are willing to pay a substantial amount for proper accommodation.
        <br>
        <br>
        With Swaps, on the other hand, you will avoid all the usual expenses that come with accommodation during travel. The transaction between Swappers is not a monetary one, but rather a truly sharing-economy based solution for accommodation, with each side in the transaction providing the other with a convenient and comfortable home. Swaps requires that Swappers provide a security deposit, which serves as a guarantee covering for very rare cases of damages or cancellations. <strong>For the price of a cheap cup of coffee</strong>, Swaps acts as a trusted third-party which holds and handles the deposit until after the swap, keeping you safe and secure. As long as no major damages or cancellations occurred, <strong>the entire sum of the security deposit will be returned to you in full</strong> at the end of your trip.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        How can I trust a Swapper if I don’t yet know them?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        First of all, we encourage you to contact and get to know your fellow Swapper before confirming a Swap. But besides that, Swaps has built a review system where Swappers are asked to rate their stays at other fellow Swappers homes. These reviews and ratings serve as an excellent means to judge whether a particular home or particular Swapper is a good fit for you.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, Swaps requires that Swappers provide a security deposit before a swap is confirmed. The security deposit serves as a guarantee to cover for very rare cases of damages or cancelations. In this way, trust is quickly built between Swappers, as potentially malicious users are deterred from using the site since they will be held accountable and will be charged if they cause any harm. It is also important to remember that even in the very rare cases of damages or unexpected cancellations, the harmed Swapper will be compensated.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, Swaps is uncompromising when it comes to Swapper security. We place a real emphasis on screening out and detecting malicious or untrustworthy people, and on removing them from the site. We have put in place a strict set of terms and conditions to best ensure that our users stay safe, no matter where they are or who stays at their home. As a matter of policy, any user who violates Swaps’ rules, endangers other Swappers or their belongings, or behaves inappropriately towards other Swappers will be immediately banned from the site. We are happy to say that so far, we have not had to ban anyone, but we are prepared for any case.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Is a swap always mutual and reciprocal?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes. Swaps is dedicated to making home swapping as comfortable and convenient as possible, and currently, we offer mutual, same-time home swaps only. This service is already great, and we are focused on perfecting it. We are constantly working to improve our technology and in the future, we plan on offering other dirt cheap accommodation options. In the meantime, enjoy Swapping!      </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Does Swaps cost money?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes, although at the end of the day, our prices amount to mere dollars per trip. Depending on the Swaps pricing plan you choose, the cost can be as low as 1$ per night! You will save literally hundreds of dollars by using Swaps rather than alternative accommodation solutions.     </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Hold on, Is there really a 1$ per night pricing plan? That sounds ridiculously cheap!
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes. Our basic pricing plan is really 1$ per night. There are no hidden fees or additional payments. It’s that simple.
        <br>
        <br>
        We agree, it is ridiculously cheap.

        How am I protected from damages in my home or unexpected cancellations when I Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Swaps requires that Swappers provide a security deposit before a swap is confirmed. The security deposit serves as a guarantee to cover for very rare cases of damages or cancelations. In such cases, the harmed Swapper will be compensated up to the amount of the security deposit.

        Setting up a Swap
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        How do I find a home to Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        On the site’s homepage, you can enter a search for homes in specific locations and dates that match your travel plans. You can be flexible if you’d like as well, and broaden your search options.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can also find the search tab at the top of the site on each page.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Do I need to enter exact dates and travel destinations in order to Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Not at all, you can be flexible when searching for a home. For example, you can choose to search for homes anywhere, or only in cities across Europe, or somewhere in India. Similarly, your dates can be flexible too, and you can search for homes available anytime, or on a specific number of days within a broader date range. The more flexible you are, the better chances you have of finding a great Swap that will be best for you.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Do I need to list my home in order to set up a Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        You do not need to list your home in order to search for homes, and are welcome to look around for the perfect spot for you. However, once you have found a home suited for your travel plans, and have attempted to request a Swap, you will be asked to list your home before you can proceed to confirm the Swap. If you have yet to sign up to the site at this stage, Swaps will require you to sign up through Facebook or Google as well.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        How do I request a Swap once I’ve found a home that interests me?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Once you’ve reached a Swappers home profile page, you will be able to request a Swap using the button on the right hand side of the page labeled <strong>Request a Swap</strong>.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Can I contact another Swapper without first requesting a Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes, once you’ve reached a Swappers home profile page, you will be able to contact the Swapper using the button on the inner part of the page.

        How do I list my home on Swaps?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Enter the My Account and go to the My Home tab. Here, you can upload photos and enter information about your home, so that other Swappers can easily find your home and offer to swap with you.
        <br>
        <br>
        You can enter swap dates and destinations with the Set up Swap label on the site’s upper tab, or in the My Swaps tab in your account.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        I’ve listed my home, does this mean any Swapper can find me and request a Swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes, once you’ve listed your home any Swapper will be able to find you and request a Swap. However, if you would like your home not to show up in searches, or to only show up in searches that match the dates on which you have entered that your home is open to Swap, you can simply uncheck the box labeled <strong>“Show my home in all Swap searches”</strong> in your account, under the My Home tab.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Is my personal information protected by Swaps?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        While most of the information you provided about your home is available for other Swappers to see, your personal information is protected and cannot be accessed by other Swappers. Aside from public information including your first name, your gender, your occupation, and the information you entered in the About Me section in your account, no other personal data can be seen by other Swappers. This means your phone number, email address, and exact home address are not visible to other Swappers if no Swap has been confirmed with them. Once a Swap has been confirmed with another Swapper, your full address will be provided to them, so that they can find the home when they arrive for a Swap. Your email and phone number are used only by us in order to keep in touch with you and to send you updates and confirmations about your Swap, yet they will never be visible to other Swappers.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        What should I avoid when messaging another Swapper?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        All messages between Swappers are sent only via the Swaps messaging feature, and never through other parties. In order to avoid possible scams and keep yourself safe, never provide credit card information, phone numbers, emails, or other contact information when messaging a fellow Swapper. Remember, Swaps does not require that money be transferred between Swappers, and in no case should someone ask you to give them money. The only time you will be asked for credit card or paypal information is via a protected service once you have requested a Swap.

    <div class="sub-title">
        What is the security deposit?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In order to protect Swappers from possible damages or unexpected cancellations, <strong>each Swapper must provide Swaps with a security deposit</strong> ahead of a scheduled home exchange. In the likely event that you caused no damage to the home when swapping and did not cancel your Swap too close to the scheduled Swap date, <strong>the entire security deposit is returned to you</strong>, without the money ever having to leave your account.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        Wait a minute, you said the security deposit doesn’t leave my account, how can that be?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        The security deposit is not charged to Swaps, but rather a credit limit is designated to Swaps in your bank or paypal account. The security deposit remains in your account and is not charged at all, except in cases where damages were claimed, or if you cancelled a Swap too close to the scheduled Swap date.
    </div>

        <br>
        <br>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Nomad</strong> - 1$ per night - 70$ deposit per week. This plan covers you for up to 70$ in damages or cancelations</li>

            <li><strong>Globetrotter</strong> - 5$ per night - 350$ deposit per week. This plan covers you for up to 350$ in damages or cancelations </li>

        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes, Swaps charges some or all of the security deposit in two very rare cases -- if damage claims were filed by the Swapper with which you swapped homes, and if you cancelled a Swap too close to a scheduled Swap date.

        Damages and Cancellations

    <div class="sub-title">
        Can I cancel a confirmed swap?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes, you can cancel a confirmed swap. However, in some cases, you will be required to pay a cancellation fee.
    </div>
    <div class="sub-title">
        What is a cancellation fee, and under what circumstances will I have to pay such a fee?
        <div class="underline"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Since Swappers who confirmed a swap are counting on each other, last minute cancellations can cause major inconveniences. Swaps has set up several types of cancellation fees, which are used as a compensation that protects Swappers and assures that they are never left stranded in case of an unexpected cancellation.

    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Yes. The average cost of a Swap night amounts to barely a few dollars, while in return you receive a great service that would have been extremely expensive otherwise. Swaps does not require you pay even one penny before finding the perfect home to swap with.
        <br>
        <br>
        At the same time, while Swaps does require that you provide a security deposit before swapping, its is important to note that the security deposit is not a payment. Instead, the security deposit serves as a guarantee to cover for very rare cases of damages or cancelations. As long as no damages or cancellations occurred, <strong>the entire sum of the security deposit will be returned to you</strong>.

    <div class="text">
        No, we don’t charge a cleaning fee and you do not need to pay for such a service. We only ask that our swappers leave a clean home before they depart on their trip, and return the home at which they stayed in the condition they received it. Of course, you can still discuss your cleaning preferences with other swappers before your trip.
