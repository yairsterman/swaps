        Deposit
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        In order to protect users from possible damages or cancellations, each user must provide Swaps with a security deposit ahead of a scheduled home exchange. The user agrees that in cases detailed in the Cancellations and Damages sections on this page, the required sums from the security deposit will be transferred to Swaps.
        <br>
        <br>
        The security deposit is not charged to Swaps, but rather a credit limit is designated to Swaps in the user’s bank or paypal account. The security deposit remains in the user’s account and is not charged to Swaps except in cases detailed in the Cancellations and Damages sections on this page. If no cases detailed in the Cancellations and Damages sections on this page occured, the credit limit for the security deposit will be released within 14 days following the last date of the home exchange and <strong>the sum of the security deposit is returned to the user</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Swaps service entails the payment of a service fee, which is calculated on the basis of the security deposit plans detailed below. Users can choose from the deposit plans best suited for their needs.
        <br>
        <br>
        In cases detailed in the Cancellations section on this page, the exchanger will receive a message from Swaps detailing if the exchanger is entitled to compensation, as well as the sum which the exchanger will receive from the user’s security deposit if compensation is due.
        <br>
        <br>
        If damages claims were reported by an exchanger within 10 days following the last date of the home exchange, the sum claimed by the exchanger will be transferred from the user’s account to Swaps. Swaps will hold the sum until the sides reach an conventional agreement or until the designated time limit, in accordance with the cases detailed in the Damages section on this page. The exchanger will receive a message from Swaps detailing if the user has agreed to the damage claims as well as the sum which the exchanger will receive from the user’s security deposit if compensation is due.
        <br>
        <br>
        In case which the sum of the damages claim reported by the exchanger is lower than the amount of the user’s security deposit, the remaining sum of the credit limit for the security deposit will be released and returned to the user.
        <br>
        <br>
        Swaps will hold the sum of the damages claim until an agreement is reached between the user and the exchanger. Once an agreement has been reached between the user and the exchanger, the sides will report it (in spacial dispute solve button that  will open in the site), and Swaps will transfer the sum to the exchanger in accordance with the agreement.

    <div class="sub-title terms">
        Cancellations
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Swaps is committed to ensuring that home exchanges set up on the site will be executed as planned, on time, and as agreed upon by users. Therefore, Swaps views cancellations of transactions or exchanges as a last resort option which should only be exercised when there is truly no other choice.
        <br>
        <br>
        However, Swaps recognizes that in certain cases cancellations are inevitable or necessary, and offers a set of terms for when such a case may arise. By using the Swaps site, the user accepts that the user is bound by the site’s cancellation rules, which may in some cases include payments or fees, as stated in the Cancellation page.
        <br>
        <br>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                Users may cancel any transaction or exchange at any time up to 14 days before the scheduled exchange date without having to incur any repercussions or penalties. In such a case, <strong>the user will not be charged with any payments or fees</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a user cancels a transaction within 14 days before a scheduled exchange, but up to 7 days before a scheduled exchange, a fee of 15% of the user’s security deposit will be charged to Swaps.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a user cancels a transaction within 7 days before a scheduled exchange, but up to 48 hours before a scheduled exchange,  a fee of 40% of the user’s security deposit will be charged to Swaps.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a user cancels a transaction within 48 hours before a scheduled exchange,  a fee of 100% of the user’s security deposit will be charged to Swaps.
            </li>
        </ul>
        In any case where a fee has been charged from a user to Swaps due to a cancellation, <strong>Swaps will transfer the fee to the exchanger as compensation for the cancellation</strong> and in order to assist the exchanger in covering expenses that may have resulted from the cancellation, minus a transaction commission of  5% from the fee that will remain in the hands of Swaps.
